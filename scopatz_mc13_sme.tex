This paper describes closed form, Taylor series approximations to the number 
product stages in a multicomponent enrichment cascade.  Such closed form 
approximations are required when a symbolic, rather than a numeric, algorithm
is used to compute the optimal cascade state.  Both first and second order 
approximations were implemented.  The first order solution was found to be 
grossly incorrect, having the wrong functional form over the entire domain.
On the other hand, the second order solution shows excellent agreement with 
the `true' solution over the domain of interest. An implementation of the 
symbolic, second order solver is available in the free \& open source 
PyNE library.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The matched abundance ratio cascade (MARC) equations calculate the concentrations
and flow rates through a multicomponent enrichment cascade contain. These may
be solved either using standard numeric optimizers or by using a symbolic 
expression library.  The advantage of using a symbolic library is that the 
representation of the MARC equations looks very similar to its mathematical form.
The disadvantage is that (without a compilation or code generation step) symbolic 
libraries tend to be significantly more computationally intensive.  In a related 
study upon which this paper is based, code generation was used and the symbolic
solution was found to be 20 - 300 times faster than a standard numeric solver.
An ecosystem of symbolic mathematics software tools are available: 
Mathematica \cite{Wolfram2008}%, 
%Maple \cite{Maple16},  Maxima \cite{Maxima5}, 
and SymPy \cite{SymPy2012}.  

The MARC equations for multicomponent separations were originally formulated 
by de la Garza \cite{DelaGarza1969}.
An example implementation of a constrained numerical optimizer solution may be 
found in PyNE and elsewhere \cite{pyne:enrichment,doi:10.1080/01496391003793884}.  
Alternatively, a symbolic implementation may also now be found in PyNE.  The symbolic
version uses variable substitution and elimination to reduce the system to one 
equation and one unknown.

However, when reducing systems by variable elimination, closed form expressions for 
all independent variables are required.  For some independent variables this is 
relatively easy to accomplish. For others, such as the number of product stages in
a cascade, it may be shown that no closed form solution is possible.  In such cases 
the strategy is to derive a closed form approximation for this independent variable.

What form this approximation takes and how accurate it needs to be are dependent on 
the actual system of equations being examined.  For MARC and the number of product
stages, a Taylor series approximation was used.  Both first and second order 
approximations are explored here.  In terms of computation efficiency, lower order 
approximations are desirable.  However, increased order may be required to 
satisfactorily be able to solve the system of equations at all.

This paper proceeds as follows.  The symbolic methodology 
is discussed in \S\ref{sec:meth}.  This includes an overview of the
MARC equations, a description of the symbolic strategy, and the
derivation of both first and second order approximations.
The results of the Taylor series approximations are then presented in \S\ref{sec:res}. 
Lastly, \S\ref{sec:conc} discusses the validity of each approximation and other
possible approximation schemes.

\section{Symbolic Methodology}
\label{sec:meth}
The MARC equations ultimately yield a minimization \cite{Wood1999}.  Traditionally, 
this is the minimization of the total flow rate $L$ normalized by the feed flow rate 
$F$ \cite{DelaGarza1969}.  It is possible to recast this system of equations 
into a single expression $L/F(M^*)$.  Once this expression is obtained, it 
may be handed off to any minimization algorithm, such as Newton's
method, the secant method, or the bisection method.  

However, the functional form of this expression determines the accuracy and 
quality and computational expense of the overall solution.   Furthermore, this 
functional form is somewhat mutable.  This is because not all independent variables
may be solved for in a closed form manner.    Various approximations are thus made 
in order to achieve the desired single expression  $L/F(M^*)$.  Here Taylor
series approximations are utilized.  The impact of the order of this Taylor series
is studied.

In \S \ref{sec:marceq} the MARC system of equations is detailed as a way 
of introducing required terminology. 
Then the symbolic recasting of the MARC equations is also carried out up to the
point where approximations are needed in 
\S \ref{sec:symes}.  Then, \S \ref{sec:aproxmeth} covers the form of both 
the first and second order Taylor series approximation.
For the remainder of \S \ref{sec:meth}, a four component uranium re-enrichment 
cascade will be used when example data is required.  This data was taken from the
VISION fuel cycle code in a potential used fuel recycle scenario \cite{Jacobson2009}.

\subsection{The MARC Equations}
\label{sec:marceq}

The method to compute matched abundance ratio cascades has been 
previously described in other sources, from de la Garza in the
1960s. This method is explained here to build up to the symbolic first and 
second order approximations.
For more information please refer to de la Garza
\cite{DelaGarza1969}, von Halle \cite{VonHalle1987}, Wood \cite{Wood1999}, 
Song \cite{doi:10.1080/01496391003793884}, or the symbolic methodology on which this 
work is directly based \cite{Scopatz2012}.

Set $N$ to be the total number of stages in an enrichment cascade, $N_P$ as the 
number of 
product stages above the feed entry point, and $N_T$ as the number of tails
stages.  Thus,
\begin{equation}
N = N_P + N_T
\end{equation}
The MARC system needs a special nuclide to also be set such that it is enriched in the 
product (subscript P).  This is called the first key component, $j$.  
There is also a second key component, $k$, from which $j$ is 
separated. Therefore $k$ can be said to be enriched in the tails stream (subscript T).

The overall stage separation factor $\alpha$ [unitless] is the per mass 
enrichment ratio from one stage to the next.  Given an $\alpha$,
stage separation factors for individual nuclides may be computed. 
These are called $\beta_i$ for the \ith component of a mixture $I$ and are 
defined by:
\begin{equation}
\beta_i = \alpha^{M^* - M_i}
\label{beta_i}
\end{equation}
$M_i$ is the molecular weight [amu] of the \ith
nuclide while $M^*$ [amu] is a flow rate optimization parameter.  An initial
guess for 
$M^*$ is normally set by the average of the molecular weights of the key components. 
Using the subscript $0$, denote the initial guess by $M_0^*$:
\begin{equation}
M_0^* = \frac{1}{2}\left(M_j + M_k\right)
\label{mstar-guess}
\end{equation}
Also the constraint $M_j < M_k$ is applied when picking the order for$j$ \& $k$.
Thus $M^*$ is bounded on the range $M^*\in[M_j,M_k]$ when minimizing $L/F$.

Call $F$, $P$, and $T$ the feed, product, and tails mass flow rates subject to 
the conservation equation,
\begin{equation}
F = P + T
\label{total-flow-constraint}
\end{equation}
Also take $x$ to be normalized mass concentration vectors such that $x_i^F$, 
$x_i^P$, $x_i^T$ are the concentrations of the \ith nuclide of the feed, product,
and tails.  From here:
\begin{equation}
1 = \sum_i^I x_i^F = \sum_i^I x_i^P = \sum_i^I x_i^T 
\end{equation}
The flow rate ratios are then seen as follows:
\begin{equation}
\frac{P}{F} = \sum_i^I x_i^F\frac{\beta_i^{N_T+1} - 1}
                                 {\beta_i^{N_T+1} - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
\label{ppf-full}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{T}{F} = \sum_i^I x_i^F\frac{1 - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
                                 {\beta_i^{N_T+1} - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
\label{tpf-full}
\end{equation}
Equations \ref{ppf-full} \&  \ref{tpf-full} may also be recast as functions
of just $j$ for an ideal cascade.
\begin{equation}
\frac{P}{F} = \frac{x_j^F - x_j^T}{x_j^P - x_j^T}
\label{ppf-key}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\frac{T}{F} = \frac{x_j^F - x_j^P}{x_j^T - x_j^P}
\label{tpf-key}
\end{equation}

Equations \ref{ppf-full} \& \ref{tpf-full} or equations \ref{ppf-key} \& 
\ref{tpf-key} both allow for the calculation of the \ith component concentrations in 
the product and tails as a function of the feed concentrations.
\begin{equation}
x_i^P = \frac{x_i^F}{\frac{P}{F}}\cdot\frac{\beta_i^{N_T+1} - 1}
                                           {\beta_i^{N_T+1} - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
\label{prod-concentration}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
x_i^T = \frac{x_i^F}{\frac{T}{F}}\cdot\frac{1 - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
                                           {\beta_i^{N_T+1} - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
\label{tail-concentration}
\end{equation}
Note that the component nuclides themselves are
also subject to mass conservation:
\begin{equation}
x_i^FF = x_i^PP + x_i^TT
\label{comp-flow-constraint}
\end{equation}

Furthermore, MARCs require that at every stage any two flows of 
the same type ($F$, $P$, \& $T$) must have the same relative concentrations of 
$j$ \& $k$.  Thus, say that $R$ is an abundance ratio.  For matched abundance 
ratio cascades, 
\begin{equation}
R^F = \frac{x_j^F}{x_k^F}; \;\;\; R^P = \frac{x_j^P}{x_k^P}; \;\;\; 
R^T = \frac{x_j^T}{x_k^T}
\label{abund_ratios}
\end{equation}
The ratios in these equations are valid for all stages in the cascade.

Lastly, the total flow rate per $F$ for a cascade is computed as follows:
\begin{equation}
\frac{L}{F} = \sum_i^I \frac{\frac{P}{F}x_i^P\ln(R^P) + \frac{T}{F}x_i^T\ln(R^T) 
                                                      - x_i^F\ln(R^F)}
                            {\ln(\beta_j)\frac{\beta_i - 1.0}{\beta_i + 1.0}}
\label{ltot-over-feed}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{ltot-over-feed} is minimized when computing the `optimal' cascade.
This is analogous to the $L/P$ expression found in \cite{Wood1999}.

Typically, the following cascade parameters are known:
$\alpha$, 
$j$, $k$, 
$M_i$ for all $i\in I$, 
$x_i^F$ for all $i\in I$, 
the key product enrichment $x_j^P$, and the key 
tails enrichment $x_j^T$.  Hence the optimized cascade is given by 
a system of three equations and three unknowns --
$N_P$, $N_T$, and $M^*$ -- and is therefore well determined.
\begin{equation}
\frac{x_j^P}{x_j^F}\cdot\frac{P}{F} - \frac{\beta_j^{N_T+1} - 1}
                                           {\beta_j^{N_T+1} - \beta_j^{-N_P}} = 0
\label{prod-constraint}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{x_j^F}{\frac{T}{F}} \cdot \frac{1 - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
                                           {\beta_j^{N_T+1} - \beta_j^{-N_P}} \right)
- \left(x_j^T\cdot\sum_i^{I} x_i^T\right) = 0
\label{tail-constraint}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\min\left[\frac{L}{F}\right]\to \frac{d}{dM^*} \frac{L}{F} = 0
\label{minlt-constraint}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{prod-constraint} is a rearrangement of equation \ref{prod-concentration}
when evaluated for the second key component.
Equation \ref{tail-constraint} is gained by equations \ref{tpf-full} \&
\ref{tail-concentration} when evaluated for the second key component.
Equation \ref{minlt-constraint} comes from the extreme value theorem of calculus
and equation \ref{ltot-over-feed}.

\subsection{Symbolic Enrichment Solver}
\label{sec:symes}

The symbolic MARC algorithm \cite{Scopatz2012} eliminates the $N_P$ and $N_T$ 
variables from equations \ref{prod-constraint}-\ref{minlt-constraint}, yielding a 
single expression for $L/F$.  This is then passed to a one dimensional minimization 
solver.  For $N_T$ a closed form expression exists.  Thus eliminating this unknown 
is easy.  However for $N_P$ a closed form expression is mathematically impossible.  
Here, first and second order approximations are implemented which solve for
$N_P$ in terms of $M^*$.  

The \emph{a priori} reason for examining both first and second order cases is that 
while the first order case will sacrifice some fidelity it will also have faster 
execution times.  Thus if the first order solution is accurate enough it would be 
advantageous to use it instead of the second order solution in the overall 
minimization calculation.  In either case, this approximation will be computed quite
often since it is inside of the $L/F$ minimizer.

Begin with the constraint seen in equation \ref{prod-constraint}, the
value of $P/F$ as per equation \ref{ppf-key}, and the number
of tails stages $N_T$.   This is given by following the closed form solution 
$N_T(N_P, M^*)$ (see \cite{Scopatz2012}):
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lcl}
N_T & = & \left[M^{*} \log{\left (\alpha \right )} - M_{j} \log{\left (\alpha \right )} + \log{\left (x^{T}_{j} \right )} + \log{\left (\frac{-1.0 + \frac{x^{P}_{j}}{x^{F}_{j}}}{x^{P}_{j} - x^{T}_{j}} \right )}  \right. \\
& & \left. - \log{\left (\frac{\alpha^{N_{P} \left(- M^{*} + M_{j}\right)} \left(x^{F}_{j} x^{P}_{j} - x^{P}_{j} x^{T}_{j}\right)}{- x^{F}_{j} x^{P}_{j} + x^{F}_{j} x^{T}_{j}} + 1 \right )}\right] \times \frac{1}{\left(- M^{*} + M_{j}\right) \log{\left (\alpha \right )}} \\
\end{array}
\label{nt_closed}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{nt_closed.eps}
\caption{$N_T(N_P, M^*)$ for a four component uranium re-enrichment cascade with 
         $N_P\in[1,50]$ and $M^*=236.547$.}
\label{nt_closed_fig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{nt_closed_fig} indicates that the closed form $N_T(N_P, M^*)$ is correct.
For an increasing number of enriching stages, the stripping stages must also 
increase to maintain the proper mass flow rates.
This data, and all further results, were computed 
with the feed concentrations in Table \ref{feed_vision}, 
$M^*=236.547$, $N_P^0=30$, $N_T^0=10$, $\alpha=1.05$, 
\nuc{U}{235} as the \jth key component, \nuc{U}{238} as the \kth key component, 
$x_j^P=0.055$, and $x_j^T=0.0025$.
Thus equation \ref{nt_closed} allows for the elimination of $N_T$ as an 
independent variable when computing $L/F$ and -- more importantly here -- $N_P$.  

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Feed flow concentrations for a four component uranium re-enrichment cascade.}
\include{feed_vision}
\label{feed_vision}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Continuing on, the next MARC constraint is given by equation \ref{tail-constraint}.  
This maintains that the tails concentration of the second key component \emph{must} 
be equal to the concentration specified in the initial conditions.  
Substituting in the closed form solution of $N_T(N_P, M^*)$ above into the constraint, 
the function $f$ may be defined:
\begin{equation}
f(N_P,M^*) =
\left(\frac{x_j^F}{\frac{T}{F}} \cdot \frac{1 - \beta_i^{-N_P}}
                                           {\beta_j^{N_T(N_P,M^*)+1} - \beta_j^{-N_P}} \right)
- \left(x_j^T\cdot\sum_i^{I} x_i^T\right) \equiv 0
\label{fdefine}
\end{equation}
The simplified version of $T/F$ in equation \ref{tpf-key} is used here.  Note
that there is no rearrangement of equation \ref{fdefine} that yields a $N_P$ as 
a function which is not dependent on itself.  Roughly speaking, this is due to the 
fact that $N_P$ occurs in equation \ref{fdefine} both in exponents of $\beta_i$ and
in exponents inside the $N_T$ substitution, which itself is in an exponent of 
$\beta_j$.  From Galois theory, these nested powers of $N_P$ imply that no closed form 
solution is possible.   Hence there is the need to approximate $f(N_P, M^*)$ and then
solve this in closed form for $N_P$.

\begin{figure}[htpb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{np_constraint.eps}
\caption{$f(N_P, M^*)$ over the range of possible $N_P$ and $M^*$ values.  The black
dashed contour line represents $f(N_P, M^*)=0$ and is the solution to the MARC 
constraint in equation \ref{tail-constraint}. 
Data was computed for a four component uranium re-enrichment cascade.}
\label{np_constraint_fig}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

To gain a sense of the structure of this equation, $f(N_P,M^*)$ was plotted as an 
unconstrained function of $N_P$ and $M^*$.
This produces a heat map that may be seen in Figure \ref{np_constraint_fig}.  
Since the range of $f$ contains both positive and negative
values, it follows that there must be some combination of the independent variables 
which satisfies the $f\equiv 0$ constraint.  The solution curve $f(N_P, M^*)=0$ is 
also shown on Figure \ref{np_constraint_fig} as the black dashed contour.  
This contour could itself provide the closed form $N_P(M^*)$ equation.
However, this methodology would be very slow.  
This is due to the large number of $f$ points which would have to be 
computed and interpolated create this curve.  This provides another 
justification as to 
why an upfront approximation of $N_P(M^*)$ was used.

\subsection{Taylor Series Approximations}
\label{sec:aproxmeth}

The value of $f(N_P,M^*)=0$ in equation \ref{fdefine} was approximated using 
Taylor series expansions to first and second order.  These were then rearranged to 
form $N_P(M^*)$ equations, which are needed to eliminate $N_P$ from the MARC system.  
Due to the symbolic nature of the underlying algorithm, the coefficients in these
polynomial expansions cannot be precomputed numerically but must be 
expressed symbolically in terms of known parameters and independent variables 
\cite{Sacks:1989:ASS:1623755.1623823}.
Note that in 
either case, the approximation of $f$ should match the dashed contour line seen in 
Figure \ref{np_constraint_fig}, especially in the region near $M_0^*$.

From here, it is easy to represent $f$ by its first order Taylor series expansion
$f^{(1)}$ with respect to $N_P$ near the initial guess $N_P^0$.
\begin{equation}
f^{(1)}(N_P,M^*) \approx f(N_P^0,M^*) + 
    \left(N_P -N_P^0\right)\left.\frac{df}{dN_P}\right|_{N_P=N_P^0}
\label{f1-taylor}
\end{equation}
By setting equation \ref{f1-taylor} to zero and rearranging, the
closed form $N_P^{(1)}(M^*)$ is obtained:
\begin{equation}
N_P^{(1)}(M^*) = N_P^0 - \frac{\left.\frac{df}{dN_P}\right|_{N_P=N_P^0}}{f(N_P^0,M^*)}
\label{np_closed1}
\end{equation}
The derivative in this equation is evaluated at the initial guess $N_P^0$.
Note that this is equivalent to Newton's method for $N_P$.

The second order Taylor series expansion, $f^{(2)}$, is as follows:
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
f^{(2)}(N_P,M^*) & \approx &f(N_P^0,M^*) \\
& & + \left(N_P -N_P^0\right)\left.\frac{df}{dN_P}\right|_{N_P=N_P^0} \\
& & + \frac{\left(N_P -N_P^0\right)^2}{2}\cdot\left.\frac{d^2f}{(dN_P)^2}\right|_{N_P=N_P^0}\\
\end{array}
\label{f2-taylor}
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{f2-taylor} may then be rearranged in a canonical polynomial form
with coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$.
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
f^{(2)}(N_P,M^*) & = & a(N_P)^2 + bN_P + c\\
a & = & \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{d^2f}{(dN_P)^2}\\
b & = & \left.\frac{df}{dN_P}\right|_{N_P=N_P^0} - N_P^0\frac{d^2f}{(dN_P)^2} \\
c & = & f(N_P^0,M^*) - N_P^0\cdot\frac{df}{dN_P} + \frac{(N_P^0)^2}{2}\frac{d^2f}{(dN_P)^2} \\
\end{array}
\label{f-cannon}
\end{equation}
All derivatives are again evaluated at $N_P=N_P^0$.
Applying the constraint $f(N_P,M^*)=0$, 
a closed form expression $N_P(M^*)$ is garnered by the 
quadratic equation.
\begin{equation}
N_P^{(2)}(M^*) = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\label{np_closed2}
\end{equation}
For the second order approximation $a$ must be positive, $b$ must be negative, 
and the discriminant is also positive.  Thus the 
negative root to the quadratic sufficient to to obtain a value of
$N_P^{(2)}(M^*)$ that is also positive and close to $N_P^0$.

To qualify the validity of the first and second order approximations, 
Figure \ref{np_closed_fig} plots both closed form solutions to $N_P(M^*)$.
In Figure \ref{np_closed_fig}(a), these solutions are shown on their own.
In Figure \ref{np_closed_fig}(b) they are overlaid onto the heat map seen in 
Figure \ref{np_constraint_fig}.  

By inspection, the first order solution is almost wholly an inappropriate choice.
It stays quite near the initial guess for most portions of the domain.  As $M^*$
approaches $M_0^*$, the first order solution does cross the $f(N_P, M^*)=0$ curve 
and obtain the correct value.  However, at this point the first order approximation 
has the wrong sign on its slope.  This alone would make it inappropriate for 
use in a minimization calculation.  Furthermore, for larger values of $M^*$, an 
asymptotic-like peak and valley form.  This effectively guarantees that any minimizer
would choose the wrong value.

On the other hand, the second order Taylor series approximation is very
accurate near the initial conditions.  As can be expected this approximation performs
less well for extreme values of $M^*$.  The second order solution over-predicts the 
result for the upper end of the domain and under-predicts for the lower end of the 
domain.  These discrepancies are expected with Taylor series.

Both equations \ref{np_closed1} \& \ref{np_closed2} may be substituted into 
equation \ref{nt_closed}.
Doing so will obtain an expressions $N_T(N_P(M^*),M^*)=N_T(M^*)$ which only depends on $M^*$ and 
the initial conditions.  Moreover, equations \ref{nt_closed} \& \ref{np_closed1} or 
equations \ref{nt_closed} \& \ref{np_closed2} could  then be substituted into 
equation \ref{ltot-over-feed}.   This would generate and expression 
$L/F(N_P(M^*),N_T(M^*),M^*)=L/F(M^*)$ only as a function of $M^*$.  From here it 
simple to minimize $L/F(M^*)$ using any one dimensional method.

Hence, Figure \ref{loverf_fig} displays $L/F(M^*)$ for both the first and second order
approximations.  The second order method computes the proper bowl-like shape that is
known to exist for MARC equations.  This function may be easily minimized.  
On the other hand, the asymptotic 
structure that was present in $N_P^{(1)}(M^*)$ is retained in the computation of 
$L/F(M^*)$.  Therefore, the first order approximation remains unacceptable when
solving for the minimum cascade.

Note that while the second order Taylor series approximation is ultimately much more 
exact, the number of operations in the final form of $L/F(M^*)$ -- without the 
elimination of common terms -- is much larger than 
in the first order case.  Table \ref{count_ops} counts the number of times
that $M^*$ appears in these expressions and the number of binary operations each 
order takes to compute $L/F$.  
 The first order approximation contains about 6\% of the
$M^*$s that the second order version does.  Furthermore, the second order 
approximation has almost 16.5 times more operations than the first order 
approximation.  Together these illustrate just how unfortunate it is that the first
order solution is not valid.  Luckily by eliminating common terms most of the 
performance edge of the first order can be regained in the second order solution
\cite{Scopatz2012}.

\section{Conclusions \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conc}

Given any system equations it is often desirable to solve them via variable 
elimination.  Unfortunately, closed form solutions for each independent variable
may not always be possible (see Galois theory).  In such cases, approximations to 
the different variables may be used to obtain closed form solutions which are
adequately accurate.  However, the order to which these approximations are made
determines the validity of the overall solution.  This order is especially 
important if the system will be optimized.  However, there is a tension between 
the quality of the solution and how expensive it is to compute.

For the multicomponent MARC enrichment equations, the number of product stages 
required does not have a closed form solution.  Here instead a first and second 
order Taylor series approximations were used.  The first order approximation 
yielded an insufficient or incorrect form over the entire domain.  However, 
the second order solution was very accurate over the domain of interest.  While 
the second order approximation deviated for extreme values of the domain, this 
tends not to matter as such domain values are not typically encountered.  
Therefore, it is recommended that all further computations use at least a second order
method.

Further work on the subject of approximating $N_P$ may include higher order Taylor
series approximations.  While these will likely give increasingly correct results 
for larger $M^*$ domains, it may not be the most efficient way to proceed.  
As these curves are smooth, other approximations may be chosen such as using 
radial basis functions, the Pade approximate, or Chebyshev rational approximations.
